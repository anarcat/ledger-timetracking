The [ledger file](ledger.lgr) file includes a [timelog](timelog).

The timelog is separate to make interaction with other tools,
e.g. `timeclock.el` or, in my case, [org-mode][]'s "clock" system with
[John Wiegley's org2tc script][].

This works in ledger-cli:

    $ ledger -f ledger.lgr bal -B
                     €10  assets:cash
                  10.00h
                    €-10  revenues:client
    --------------------
                  10.00h

But fails in hledger:

    $ hledger -f ledger.lgr bal
    creating default conversion rules file /home/anarcat/notes/tt-test/test.lgr.rules, edit this file for better results
    hledger: "/home/anarcat/notes/tt-test/test.lgr" (line 1, column 1):
    unexpected 'a'
    expecting journal transaction or directive or end of input
    1$ 

Of course, it chokes on the `apply account` directive from ledger. But
even using the regular `hledger` include fails:

    $ hledger -f hledger.lgr bal
    using conversion rules file /home/anarcat/notes/tt-test/test.hlgr.rules
    hledger: "/home/anarcat/notes/tt-test/test.hlgr" (line 2, column 1) in included file "test.timelog":
    "/home/anarcat/notes/tt-test/test.timelog" (line 1, column 1):
    unexpected 'i'
    expecting journal transaction or directive or end of input
    1$ 

I may be able to feed the timetracking data directly in the
`hledger.lgr` file, but
that's rather painful: i'd like to keep that messy file separate from
the main accounting.
